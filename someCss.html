        <h3>About Me:</h3>
            <p>Hello, my name is Spongebob Squarepants, I am a yellow square sponge that
            lives under the sea. I live in a Pineapple house under the sea. I have friends that
            is a starfish named Patrick and another that is a squid named Squidward. I love living
            under the sea because it is quiet and there's no human beings bothering us. It is like
            we have our own little world. 

            My world is full of water, yet I can still work as a cook at the Krusty Krab 
            Restaurant where it is owned by Mr. Krabs, the one and only!!! Mr. Krabs loves my cooking
            skills and only charges me $5 an hour to cook one of the best hamburgers under the sea.
            Please whenever you have time, come stop by and taste my hamburger at the Krusty Krabs
            Restaurant!!! Thank you :)
            </p>
